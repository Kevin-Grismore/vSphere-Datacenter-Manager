# vSphere-Datacenter-Manager
This project automates the clone-deploy-boot process that was previously conducted manually in vCenter by the client. 
Clone, deploy, and boot are the steps undertaken on the datacenter to prepare VMs for use. In this case, VMs were used as labs for VMware certification classes.
